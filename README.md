# algorytmy-grafowe

This repository contains code from Graph Algorithms course from the 3rd semester of computer science studies at AGH University of Science and Technology - Krak√≥w

The course was a continuation of Algorithm and Data Structures course from the previous semester

### code and enviroment

The code was written in Python3. Code necessary for loading graphs is provided in 'dimacs.py' files in each lab's directory
